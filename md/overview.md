# Project Overview

## ReelAI: Reimagining TikTok With AI

### Background
TikTok revolutionized video sharing and content creation, but it emerged in a pre-AI world. ReelAI envisions an AI-first approach where intelligent features enhance every aspect of the video experience—from creation to consumption.

### Project Phases
- **Week 1: Rapid Development**  
  Build a complete vertical slice for a specific user type. In this case, the focus is on Minecraft video consumers. The MVP includes:
  - A curated video feed
  - Video interaction (likes and comments)
  - Personal playlists
  - Subscriptions for following creators
  - Notifications for new content
  - Social sharing of videos

- **Week 2: AI Innovation**  
  Enhance the MVP by integrating AI-driven features that improve content creation and user engagement, such as smart editing commands or tailored video recommendations.

### Tech Stack & Niche
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - **Firebase:** Handle authentication, real-time data with Firestore, media storage via Cloud Storage, serverless logic with Cloud Functions, and more.
  - **Flutter:** A cross-platform framework that enables the mobile app to be deployed on the web—ideal for broad testing and rapid iteration.
  
- **Niche:**  
  Targeting Minecraft video consumers, the app caters to users looking for trending Minecraft content, tutorials, and gameplay insights with a community-driven experience.

This approach sets a robust foundation for a modern, AI-augmented video platform that starts with essential social interactions and evolves to offer innovative, intelligent video features.
