# ReelAI MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to build the MVP for ReelAIâ€”a reimagined TikTok-style video platform using Firebase (for backend services) and Flutter (for cross-platform mobile & web deployment). The MVP focuses on these core features for Minecraft video consumers:
- Video Feed
- Video Interaction (likes and comments)
- Add Video to Playlist
- Subscribe to a User
- Enable Notifications for a User
- Share Video

> **Note:** This implementation plan is for a course project. I (the AI coding tool) will be implementing this as a learning exercise and demonstration. Although this project is not intended for real users, we will simulate a proper development vs. production separation.

## Step 1: Initial Setup & Planning âœ…
- **Define Requirements & Scope:**  
  - âœ… Confirm the MVP user stories and overall functionality.
  - Finalize data modeling/schema for videos, users, playlists, likes, comments, and subscriptions in Firestore.
- **Environment Setup:**  
  - âœ… Install the Flutter SDK and any required IDE (e.g., VS Code or Android Studio).
  - âœ… Initialize a new Flutter project and configure version control (e.g., a GitHub repository).
- **Dev/Prod Environment Configuration:**  
  - **Create Two Firebase Projects:**  
    - âœ… One for **development/staging** (dev) and one for **production** (prod).
  - **Manage Environment Variables:**  
    - Use a package like `flutter_dotenv` to maintain separate configuration files (e.g., `.env.dev` and `.env.prod`) containing different Firebase API keys, project IDs, and other settings.

## Step 2: Integrate Firebase with the Flutter App âœ…
- **Add Dependencies:**  
  Update your `pubspec.yaml` to include:
  - âœ… `firebase_core`
  - âœ… `cloud_firestore`
  - âœ… `firebase_storage`
  - `firebase_messaging`
  - âœ… Optional: `firebase_auth` (if user registration/login is required), `video_player` (for video playback), and `share_plus` (for sharing functionality)
- **Initialize Firebase:**  
  - âœ… In `main.dart`, load the correct environment file (using `flutter_dotenv`) and initialize Firebase with the appropriate configuration based on the current environment (dev or prod).

## Step 3: Build the Video Feed ðŸš§
- **UI Development:**  
  - âœ… Design a responsive feed screen using Flutter widgets (e.g., `ListView.builder`) to display video cards.
  - âœ… Ensure the UI scales across mobile and web.
- **Data Integration:**  
  - In Firestore, create a `videos` collection with necessary metadata (title, description, creator ID, video URL, thumbnail URL).
  - Implement real-time querying to fetch and display videos in the feed.
- **Video Playback:**  
  - Integrate the `video_player` package so that tapping a video card plays the video inline or in a dedicated player view.

## Step 4: Implement Video Interactions (Likes & Comments)
- **Like Functionality:**  
  - Add a like button on each video card.
  - Update the Firestore video document to reflect like counts in real time.
- **Comment Functionality:**  
  - Create a detailed video view where users can read and post comments.
  - Store comments in a subcollection under each video document in Firestore.
  - Implement real-time comment updates using Firestore's listeners.

## Step 5: Develop the Playlist Feature
- **UI for Playlists:**  
  - Create screens that allow users to view, create, and manage personal playlists.
  - Implement "Add to Playlist" functionality from the video detail view.
- **Data Model:**  
  - In Firestore, store playlists as a collection or as a subcollection within user documents. Reference video IDs within each playlist.
- **Integration:**  
  - Ensure that adding a video updates the corresponding playlist document in Firestore.

## Step 6: Subscription & Notification Features
- **Subscription Functionality:**  
  - Add a subscribe button on user profiles or video cards.
  - Store subscriber relationships in Firestore (e.g., a `subscriptions` field within a user document or a dedicated collection).
- **Notifications:**  
  - Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to support in-app and push notifications.
  - Set up logic (or simple Cloud Functions) to trigger notifications when a subscribed creator uploads a new video.
  - Provide a settings page for users to enable/disable notifications for specific creators.

## Step 7: Implement Video Sharing
- **UI Integration:**  
  - Add a share button on the video detail view.
- **Sharing Logic:**  
  - Utilize the `share_plus` package to invoke the device's native share dialog.
  - Generate shareable links (consider dynamic links or deep linking to direct users to the appropriate content).

## Step 8: Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit & Integration Testing:**  
  - Write tests for video querying, like/comment updates, playlist management, and subscription features.
- **Manual Testing:**  
  - Test the application across multiple devices (mobile and web) to ensure a consistent responsive design.
- **Security & Firestore Rules:**  
  - Implement Firestore and Storage security rules to protect data.
- **Environment Testing:**  
  - Verify both the dev and prod configurations locally by switching environment files.

## Step 9: Deployment and Distribution Options
- **Build for Web & Mobile:**  
  Use Flutter's build commands to compile the app for both web and mobile platforms.
  
- **Deployment Strategy:**  
  - **Development Environment:**  
    - Deploy the staging/demo version using the dev Firebase project.
    - For web distribution, use Firebase Hosting.
    - For mobile testing, consider using Firebase App Distribution to quickly deliver builds internally.
  
  - **Production Environment:**  
    - Once features are stable and thoroughly tested in the development environment, update your configuration to use the production Firebase project and deploy the production version.
    - For web distribution, deploy to Firebase Hosting.
    - For mobile distribution, either use Firebase App Distribution or prepare for eventual deployment via official app stores.
  
- **Monitoring:**  
  Use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to monitor app performance and track issues in both environments.

## Step 10: Documentation & Final Touches
- **Documentation:**  
  - Update the GitHub repository README with setup instructions, including how to switch between dev and prod using environment configurations.
  - Ensure the user stories and project overview documents are up-to-date.
- **Walkthrough Video:**  
  - Prepare a short walkthrough video demonstrating the core MVP functionalities and a brief explanation of the dev/prod setup.

## Final Steps: Review & Iterate
- **User Feedback:**  
  - Gather informal feedback from testers (appropriate for a course project).
- **Plan for Future Enhancements:**  
  - Identify AI-driven features for Week 2 (smart editing, tailored recommendations, etc.).
- **Iteration:**  
  - Optimize performance, fix bugs, and refine the user experience based on feedback.
