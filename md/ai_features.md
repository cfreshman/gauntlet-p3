# AI Features Implementation Plan

## Feature 1: RAG-Enhanced Search
Uses RAG to enable semantic search across video content.

### User Stories
1. "As a Minecraft player, I can search 'redstone builds for beginners' and find relevant videos even if titles don't exactly match"
2. "As a Minecraft player, I can search 'medieval house no mods' and get videos that match the concept, not just the keywords"
3. "As a Minecraft player, I can find videos based on concepts and ideas, not just literal text matches"

### Implementation
- Store video metadata (title, description, tags) in vector DB
- Generate embeddings for all video content
- Use RAG to:
  - Process natural language queries
  - Find semantically similar content
  - Rank by relevance
- Return videos based on semantic similarity

## Feature 2: RAG-Enhanced Feed
Uses RAG to analyze video content and user behavior for personalization.

### User Stories
4. "As a Minecraft player, my feed shows more videos similar to ones I've watched fully"
5. "As a Minecraft player, my feed adapts to my preferred build styles (modern, medieval, redstone, etc.)"
6. "As a Minecraft player, my feed shows more content from creators whose videos I engage with"

### Implementation
- Store video metadata (title, description, tags) in vector DB
- Track user behavior:
  - Watch time
  - Video completions
  - Likes/comments
  - Creator follows
- Use RAG to:
  - Analyze patterns in watched content
  - Identify preferred content types
  - Generate personalized feed rankings
- Sort feed based on similarity scores

## Technical Components
1. Vector Database (Pinecone)
   - Store all video metadata embeddings
   - Enable semantic search
   - Power content similarity matching
   - Support feed personalization

2. OpenAI API Integration
   - Generate embeddings
   - Process queries
   - Analyze content similarity

3. Firebase Integration
   - Store user behavior data
   - Track video metadata
   - Handle authentication

4. Evaluation (LangSmith)
   - Track search relevance
   - Monitor feed relevance
   - Measure semantic matching accuracy

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: RAG Infrastructure
1. Set up Pinecone DB
2. Implement embedding generation
3. Create RAG utilities
4. Set up evaluation

### Phase 2: Search & Feed
1. Implement semantic search
2. Add user behavior tracking
3. Create personalized ranking
4. Integrate with frontend
5. Test and optimize

## Success Metrics
- Search semantic relevance
- Feed content relevance
- Watch completion rates
- User retention
